	<h1>Jaipur</h1>
	<p>Jaipur became known as “The Pink City” when, in 1876, Maharaja Ram Singh had most of the buildings painted pink—the color of hospitality—in preparation for a visit by Britain's Queen Victoria. Today, the city is known for its bazaars, forts, temples, palaces, and wildlife sanctuaries.</p>
